# The Coin Change Problem
A dynamic programming solution to the [simple coin change problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem#Simple_dynamic_programming) implemented in C++, given the assumption that the list of **denomination has a value of 1**. 

### Running the application
```
g++ -o <name-you-want-to-give> COIN_CHANGE.cpp
cd /<name-you-gave>
```

#### Solved it as part of my algorithms course in 2016, hope it helps someone.
